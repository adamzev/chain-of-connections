      Solve a Connections word puzzle by grouping 16 words into four sets of four based on shared connections. Some links are obvious, while others require wordplay or modifications. Groups are color-coded by difficulty:
        Yellow (most straightforward): Often a shared meaning
        Green: sometimes a shared category
        Blue: sometimes components of a category
        Purple (most difficult): Requires phrases, wordplay, or subtle links

      The above is a loose guideline and other types of connections exist such as appearing in the same piece of popular culture or wordplay (homonyms).
  
      Common words may refer to their common meanings or function as proper nouns, such as brand names, titles, or other things from popular culture.

      Identify four groups of four words and state their connections.

      Check if the solution below is correct. You are checking for misgrouped words but can assume it is a valid possible solution.
      If a connection is overly complex or relies on "and" (e.g., foods and silverware), it's likely incorrect.
      If the solution is correct, submit the results (submit=True) without advice.
      If incorrect, provide specific advice to a new solver regarding what words may go together and which words do not.
